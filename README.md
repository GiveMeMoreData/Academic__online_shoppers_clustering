# Predicting online shoppers action using clustering ML models
### This respository is a direct copy of a github respository used in Introduction to Machine Learning classes

#### It should be stated that this work was done by Bartłomiej Eljasiak, Mateusz Grzyb and Mariusz Słapek.

## Milestones
### 1. Data exploration
### 2. Feature engineering - encoding features and first look into clusters
### 3. Model analysis - Analysis of clusters and implementing model in practice 

Recomended way of exploring this project is seeing the code from third milestone, later launching user-simulator and after that code inspection.
